    "\n",
    "1.  `data = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"grape\", \"kiwi\"]`\n",
    "    *   This line creates a list named `data` containing four strings: \"apple\", \"banana\", \"grape\", and \"kiwi\". This is our initial dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  `data.sort(key=lambda x: len(x))`\n",
    "    *   This is the core of the example. It uses the `sort()` method of the list object `data` to sort the list *in place* (meaning it modifies the original `data` list directly).\n",
    "    *   The `key` argument of the `sort()` method is the most important part.  The `key` argument *specifies a function* that determines the sorting order.  This function is applied to each element of the list before comparisons are made.\n",
    "    *   `lambda x: len(x)`: This is a lambda function. Let's dissect it:\n",
    "        *   `lambda`:  This keyword introduces a lambda function, which is a small, anonymous (unnamed) function.\n",
    "        *   `x`:  This is the parameter of the lambda function. `x` represents the *current element* being considered for sorting in the list.\n",
    "        *   `: len(x)`: This is the expression that the lambda function evaluates and returns.  `len(x)` calculates the *length* (number of characters) of the current element `x`.  The returned length is what `sort()` uses to compare elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   In essence, for each string in the list, the lambda function `lambda x: len(x)` calculates the length of the string. The `sort()` method then uses these lengths to arrange the strings in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  `print(data)`  # ['kiwi', 'apple', 'grape', 'banana']\n",
    "    *   This line prints the sorted `data` list to the console. The output confirms that the list has been sorted based on the lengths of the strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Lambda Functions and Their Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **What is a Lambda Function?**\n",
    "    *   A lambda function is a concise way to define a small, single-expression function *without* using the `def` keyword and a formal function name. They are often used for simple operations, particularly when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function (like in this case, as the `key` argument to `sort()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why Use a Lambda Here?**\n",
    "    *   In this example, the sorting criteria is very simple: sort by string length.  A lambda function perfectly fits this scenario because:\n",
    "        *   It's short and easy to read.\n",
    "        *   It avoids the need to define a regular function with a name (e.g., `def string_length(x): return len(x)`).\n",
    "        *   It's often preferred for inline, one-off operations where a full function definition would be overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How `key` Works:**\n",
    "    *   The `key` argument in the `sort()` method expects a function that takes a single argument (an element from the list) and returns a value that can be used for comparison.\n",
    "    *   The `sort()` method then uses these returned values to determine the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**  The code uses a lambda function to provide a custom sorting key. The lambda function calculates the length of each string in the list and uses those lengths to order the strings. This is a common and powerful technique for customizing sorting in Python.\n",

    "\n",

    "**Code Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`def api_call(resource, /, *, token=None):`**\n",
    "   - This defines a function named `api_call`.\n",
    "   - `resource`: This is a regular parameter.  It's the resource being accessed (e.g., \"users\", \"products\", etc.).\n",
    "   - `*,`: This is a crucial part.  The `*` indicates that any parameters following it are *keyword-only* arguments. This means you *must* pass them explicitly using their names (e.g., `token=...`).\n",
    "   - `token=None`: This is the `token` parameter, which is optional and defaults to `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`if token is None:`**\n",
    "   - This line checks if a token was provided when the function was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`raise ValueError(\"Token required\")`**\n",
    "   - If no token is provided, this raises a `ValueError` with a helpful message. This is a mechanism to prevent the function from proceeding without the necessary authentication information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`return f\"Accessing {resource} with token {token}\"`**\n",
    "   - If a token *was* provided, this line constructs a formatted string that indicates the resource being accessed and the token used. This is just a placeholder, in a real application, this would actually make the API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`print(api_call(\"users\", token=\"abc123\"))  # ✅ Works`**\n",
    "   - This line calls the `api_call` function with the `resource` set to \"users\" and the `token` set to \"abc123\". Because the token is provided, the function executes successfully and prints the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`# api_call(resource=\"users\", token=\"abc123\") ❌ TypeError`**\n",
    "   - This is a comment indicating what happens if you call the function without using keyword arguments. The function expects `token` to be passed as a keyword argument. Passing it as a regular argument will result in a `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`# Use / to prevent breaking API contracts if you change param names later.`**\n",
    "   - This is a key comment explaining the use of the `/` notation.\n",

    "**API Guard Rails and How They're Used in This Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are API Guard Rails?**\n",
    "\n",
    "API guard rails are design patterns and coding techniques used to enforce rules and constraints on how an API is used. They're essentially safeguards that prevent misuse, unexpected behavior, and ensure consistency between different parts of your system. They are primarily used to protect the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Code Demonstrates Guard Rails**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Keyword-Only Arguments ( `/`):** This is the primary guard rail being used.  The `*` and `/` together tell Python that the `token` parameter *must* be passed as a keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Purpose:**  This prevents a developer from accidentally passing `token` as a regular argument.  It forces them to use the correct syntax, which helps ensure that the code is used in the intended way.\n",
    "   - **Flexibility:**  Even if you decide to rename the `token` parameter to something like `authentication_token` in the future, the `*` and `/`  will still prevent code that currently uses `token` from breaking. You can refactor the code and the guard rail will keep the function working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error Handling ( `ValueError`):** Raising a `ValueError` when the token is missing is another guard rail. It ensures that the API doesn't proceed with incomplete or invalid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Using API Guard Rails**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prevent Misuse:**  Guard rails make it harder for developers to misuse the API and make incorrect calls.\n",
    "* **Maintainability:**  They make your API more stable and easier to maintain over time. Changes to the API's implementation won't inadvertently break code that relies on its public interface.\n",
    "* **Contract Enforcement:** They help enforce the contract between the API and its consumers.\n",
    "* **Future-Proofing:** You can change the API’s internal workings without breaking existing code that uses it, as long as the public interface (the parameters and return values) remain consistent.\n"
