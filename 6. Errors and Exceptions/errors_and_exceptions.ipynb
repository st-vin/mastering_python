    "1. **`try` Clause:** The `try` statement is the core. It contains the code that might raise an exception.  In this example, we have three separate `try` blocks.\n",

    "2. **`except` Clause:** The `except` clause specifies what to do if a certain type of exception occurs within the corresponding `try` clause.\n",

    "3. **Multiple `except` Clauses:** This code demonstrates the ability to have multiple `except` clauses. Each `except` clause handles a different type of exception.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Scoped Handlers:**  The handlers are *scoped* to the `try` statement they're associated with.  If an exception occurs in `try` block 1, it won't affect the execution of `try` block 2 or 3.  Similarly, a `ValueError` handled in `try` block 2 won't affect the handling of `ZeroDivisionError` in `try` block 1.\n",

It's passing two arguments ('spam' and 'eggs') to the constructor of the `Exception` class. These arguments are bundled together in the exception object, just like we talked about.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   * `except Exception as inst:`:  This is the core of exception handling. The `as inst` part assigns the exception object that was raised to a variable named `inst`.  `inst` is now a reference to the exception instance that's created when the `raise` statement executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Printing the Exception Type (`type(inst)`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `print(type(inst))`: This line shows you the *type* of the exception object. In this case, it will print `<class 'Exception'>`.  This confirms that `inst` contains an instance of the `Exception` base class. It demonstrates that the exception is stored within the `inst` variable.\n",

    "   * `print(inst)`: This is where the magic of the `__str__()` method comes in.  Python automatically calls the `__str__()` method on the exception object when you try to print it directly.  The `__str__()` method is designed to provide a user-friendly representation of the exception, and in this case, it automatically prints the arguments stored in `inst.args`.  The output will be: `('spam', 'eggs')`.\n",

    "**Understanding Exception Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an error (an exception) happens in your Python code – like trying to divide by zero, trying to access an index that’s out of range for a list, or having a file that doesn’t exist – Python raises an exception.  These exceptions aren't just about saying \"something went wrong\". They often carry *information* about *why* it went wrong. This information is bundled together as \"arguments\" associated with the exception object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** These arguments help you understand the details of the error, such as the value that caused the problem, the filename, or the specific index that was out of bounds.\n",
    "* **Variety:** The exact arguments depend on the *type* of exception you’re dealing with.  A `ValueError` might have an argument called `args` containing the invalid value, while a `FileNotFoundError` might have `args` containing the name of the missing file.\n",
    "* **`args` Attribute:**  Most exceptions (especially built-in ones) have an attribute called `args`. This `args` attribute is a *tuple* that stores the arguments passed to the exception's constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Access Exception Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access these arguments in a few ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the `.args` Attribute:**  This is the standard and most direct way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `__str__()` (for Built-in Exceptions):**  Built-in exceptions (like `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`, `FileNotFoundError`) automatically define a `__str__()` method. This method, when called on the exception object, will typically print all the exception’s arguments in a user-friendly way.  You don’t need to explicitly access `args` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1: IndexError\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "    print(f\"Arguments: {e.args}\") # prints the file path\n",
    "    print(f\"Missing file: {e.args[0]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try...except` Block:** This structure allows you to handle exceptions gracefully. The code in the `try` block is where you might expect an exception to occur. If an exception is raised, the code in the `except` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`as e`:**  This part of the `except` clause assigns the exception object to a variable named `e`.  This variable lets you work with the specific exception that was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`e.args`:** This is the key part.  `e.args` is a tuple that contains all the arguments passed to the exception’s constructor.  You can access these arguments using indexing (e.g., `e.args[0]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`__str__()` (Implicit):** When you print the exception object (`print(e)`), Python automatically calls the `__str__()` method on the exception object.  The `__str__()` method prints the information about the exception, including its arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error Information:** Exception arguments provide valuable details about the cause of an error.\n",
    "* **Exception Object:** You work with exceptions through the exception object (`e`).\n",
    "* **`args` Attribute:** Use the `e.args` attribute to access the arguments.\n",
    "* **`__str__()` (for Built-ins):**  Leverage the automatic printing provided by the `__str__()` method for convenience, especially when dealing with built-in exceptions.\n"

    "**Line-by-Line Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `for arg in sys.argv[1:]:`\n",
    "    *   This line initiates a `for` loop that iterates through the command-line arguments passed to the Python script.\n",
    "    *   `sys.argv` is a list that contains the command-line arguments.\n",
    "    *   `sys.argv[0]` is always the name of the script itself.\n",
    "    *   `sys.argv[1:]` creates a slice of the `sys.argv` list, starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.  This means the loop will process each argument *after* the script name.\n",
    "    *   In each iteration, the current argument is assigned to the variable `arg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  `try:`\n",
    "    *   This starts the `try` block. The code within the `try` block is the code that might potentially raise an exception (an error).  In this case, it attempts to open a file specified by the `arg` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  `f = open(arg, 'r')`\n",
    "    *   This is the core file operation.  It attempts to open the file specified by the `arg` variable in read mode ('r').\n",
    "    *   If the file exists and is accessible, the `open()` function returns a file object, which is assigned to the variable `f`.\n",
    "    *   **If the file cannot be opened** (e.g., the file doesn't exist, you don't have permission to read it, or the filename is incorrect), the `open()` function raises an `OSError` (Operating System Error).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  `except OSError:`\n",
    "    *   This is the `except` block. It catches the `OSError` that might be raised by the `open()` function in the `try` block.\n",
    "    *   If an `OSError` occurs, the code inside this `except` block is executed.\n",
    "    *   In this case, it prints a message to the console indicating that the file could not be opened, along with the name of the file (`arg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  `print('cannot open', arg)`\n",
    "    *   This line prints a user-friendly error message to the console, informing the user that the file could not be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  `else:`\n",
    "    *   This is the crucial part for understanding the concept we're discussing. The `else` clause in a `try...except...else` block is executed *only if* no exception was raised in the `try` block.  In other words, the `else` block is executed only when the `try` block completes successfully (without encountering an error).\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  `print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')`\n",
    "    *   This line is executed *only if* the `open()` function succeeded.  It prints the name of the file (`arg`) along with the number of lines in the file.\n",
    "    *   `f.readlines()` reads all the lines from the file into a list of strings.\n",
    "    *   `len(f.readlines())` calculates the number of elements in the list, which is the number of lines in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  `f.close()`\n",
    "    *   This line closes the file object `f`. It's essential to close files after you're finished with them to release resources and ensure that changes are saved to the file.  It's generally a good practice to always `close()` files you open.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the `else` Clause and How it Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` clause in `try...except...else` provides a distinct block of code that runs when the `try` block completes without any exceptions. This is a useful pattern when you want to perform some action only if an operation succeeded, and you don't want to execute that code if an error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the `else` clause allows us to print the number of lines in a file *only* if the file was successfully opened and read. If the file cannot be opened (due to an `OSError`), the `except` block is executed, and the `else` clause is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`try`**:  The code you want to execute, which might raise an exception.\n",
    "*   **`except`**:  The code to handle a specific exception.\n",
