    "# Python Classes: Complete Guide for Junior Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are blueprints for creating objects that bundle data (attributes) and functions (methods) together. Think of a class as a template - like a cookie cutter that creates similar objects with the same structure but different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Class definition - the blueprint\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        return f\"The {self.make} {self.model} engine is now running!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects (instances) from the class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n",
    "your_car = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class vs Instance: Understanding the Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Objects\n",
    "- The class itself, before creating any instances\n",
    "- Can access class attributes and methods directly\n",
    "- Used as a factory to create instances\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Objects\n",
    "- Individual objects created from a class\n",
    "- Each instance has its own copy of instance variables\n",
    "- Can access both class and instance attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canis lupus\"  # Class variable - shared by all dogs\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name      # Instance variable - unique to each dog\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances\n",
    "buddy = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "max_dog = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(Dog.species)        # Access class variable through class\n",
    "print(buddy.species)      # Access class variable through instance\n",
    "print(buddy.name)         # Access instance variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `__init__` Method (Constructor)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is automatically called when you create a new instance. It's where you set up the initial state of your object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name      # Instance attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age        # Instance attribute\n",
    "        self.friends = []     # Instance attribute (empty list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you do this:\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "# Python automatically calls: Person.__init__(person, \"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instance vs Class Variables: Critical Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Variables\n",
    "- Unique to each object\n",
    "- Defined inside `__init__` with `self.variable_name`\n",
    "- Different instances can have different values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Variables\n",
    "- Shared by ALL instances of the class\n",
    "- Defined directly in the class body\n",
    "- Same value for all instances (unless overridden)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    bank_name = \"Global Bank\"        # Class variable - same for all accounts\n",
    "    interest_rate = 0.02             # Class variable\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, owner, balance):\n",
    "        self.owner = owner           # Instance variable - unique per account\n",
    "        self.balance = balance       # Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "account1 = BankAccount(\"John\", 1000)\n",
    "account2 = BankAccount(\"Jane\", 2000)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(account1.bank_name)    # \"Global Bank\"\n",
    "print(account2.bank_name)    # \"Global Bank\" (same for all)\n",
    "print(account1.balance)      # 1000 (different for each)\n",
    "print(account2.balance)      # 2000 (different for each)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods: Functions That Belong to Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on the object's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.result = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def add(self, number):\n",
    "        self.result += number\n",
    "        return self.result\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def multiply(self, number):\n",
    "        self.result *= number\n",
    "        return self.result\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def reset(self):\n",
    "        self.result = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "calc = Calculator()\n",
    "calc.add(5)        # self.result becomes 5\n",
    "calc.multiply(3)   # self.result becomes 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding `self`\n",
    "- `self` refers to the specific instance calling the method\n",
    "- Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument\n",
    "- You must include `self` as the first parameter in every instance method\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# When you call:\n",
    "calc.add(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python actually does:\n",
    "Calculator.add(calc, 5)  # Passes the instance as first argument\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance: Building on Existing Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class (parent)\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} makes a sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Derived class (child)\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call parent's __init__\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Override parent method\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} barks!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def fetch(self):  # Add new method\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} fetches the ball!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # \"Buddy barks!\" (overridden method)\n",
    "print(dog.fetch())  # \"Buddy fetches the ball!\" (new method)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
    "When Python looks for a method, it searches in this order:\n",
    "1. The instance's class\n",
    "2. Parent classes (left to right if multiple inheritance)\n",
    "3. Their parent classes (recursively)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        return \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        return \"B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        return \"C\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class D(B, C):  # Multiple inheritance\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "d = D()\n",
    "print(d.method())  # \"B\" - searches D, then B, then C, then A\n",
    "print(D.__mro__)   # Shows the exact search order\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Mutable Class Variables (Common Bug)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# WRONG - Don't do this!\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    grades = []  # Shared by ALL students!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def add_grade(self, grade):\n",
    "        self.grades.append(grade)\n",
    "\n",
    "# CORRECT - Do this instead\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.grades = []  # Each student gets their own list\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def add_grade(self, grade):\n",
    "        self.grades.append(grade)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Private Variables Convention\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.public_var = \"Anyone can access this\"\n",
    "        self._internal_var = \"Intended for internal use\"\n",
    "        self.__private_var = \"Name mangled to _MyClass__private_var\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Examples for Interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Class Implementation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Inheritance Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} {self.model}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, doors):\n",
    "        super().__init__(brand, model)\n",
    "        self.doors = doors\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{super().info()} with {self.doors} doors\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Encapsulation (Private Variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn’t enforce strict privacy like Java or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "_var → “internal use” (not really private).\n",
    "\n",
    "__var → triggers name mangling (helps avoid clashes in subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "But: everything is still technically accessible — privacy is by convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts for Technical Interviews\n",

    "### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming Principles**\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Different classes can have methods with the same name\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **When to Use Classes**\n",
    "- When you need to create multiple objects with similar structure\n",
    "- When you want to group related data and functions together\n",

    "- When modeling real-world entities in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Class vs Function: When to Choose**\n",
    "- Use **functions** for simple operations or calculations\n",
    "- Use **classes** when you need to maintain state or create multiple similar objects\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **\"What's the difference between instance and class variables?\"**\n",
    "   - Instance variables are unique per object, class variables are shared by all instances\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **\"How does inheritance work in Python?\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. `__slots__` for Memory-Heavy Objects\n",
    "If you're creating thousands of instances, `__slots__` can save significant memory:\n",

    "class Point:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class DataProcessor:\n",

    "## Testing Classes: What Actually Matters\n",

    "### Test State Changes, Not Implementation\n",

    "## My Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start simple.** Don't architect for problems you don't have yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Favor readability.** Your code will be read 10x more than it's written.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **When in doubt, use functions.** Classes add complexity. Only use them when the complexity pays off.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Learn the standard library.** Before writing a custom class, check if Python already has what you need (`collections.namedtuple`, `dataclasses`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Practice explaining your classes.** If you can't explain why you used a class in one sentence, you probably shouldn't have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best classes solve real problems and make your code easier to understand and maintain. Everything else is just showing off.</parameter>\n",

    "  * You need **multiple objects** with similar structure but different state.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Defined in `__init__`.\n",
    "  * Each object gets its own copy.\n",
    "  * Use when the data belongs to a *specific instance*.\n",

    "  class Car:\n",
    "      wheels = 4   # class variable\n",

    "# 🔑 1. What Are **Properties** in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **property** is a way to control **attribute access** in classes (getting, setting, deleting) while still using attribute-like syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self._name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "u = User(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(u._name)     # direct access\n",
    "u._name = \"Bob\"    # direct assignment (no validation, no control)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self._name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def name(self):   # getter\n",
    "        return self._name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @name.setter\n",
    "    def name(self, value):   # setter\n",
    "        if not value.strip():\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Name cannot be empty\")\n",
    "        self._name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "u = User(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(u.name)     # calls getter under the hood\n",
    "u.name = \"Bob\"    # calls setter (with validation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ You still *use it like an attribute*, but behind the scenes you can add validation, logging, or computation.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **decorator** in Python is just **syntactic sugar**:\n",
    "It’s a function that takes another function (or method) and modifies/enhances its behavior, returning a new one.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def shout(func):\n",

    "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        return result.upper()\n",

    "    return f\"hello {name}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greet(\"world\"))  # HELLO WORLD\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `@shout` modifies the behavior of `greet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So `@property` is just a **built-in decorator** that modifies a method so it behaves like a read-only attribute.\n",
